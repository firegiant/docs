With HeatWave, you can convert WiX v3 .wixproj projects to modern WiX using the `Upgrade to latest WiX version...` command on the Project menu or context menu in Solution Explorer.

When you confirm, HeatWave converts the WiX v3 .wixproj to the latest version of WiX as an SDK-style MSBuild project. It also converts the WiX source files you selected. If HeatWave encountered any errors during the automated conversion, it shows them in a .log file so you can rectify the problem using human-brain-style conversion. [The WiX team is collecting real-world reports of how to handle manual conversion here.](/wix/whatsnew/faqs/)
