HeatWave is FireGiant's Visual Studio extension for modern WiX. HeatWave Community Edition is available free of charge and provides:

-   Conversion of WiX v3 projects and authoring
-   Building of modern WiX SDK-style projects
-   Project references and WiX extension package references
-   Project and item templates
-   Property pages to control how the project builds

HeatWave peacefully coexists with the WiX v3 Visual Studio extension, which lets you mix and match WiX v3 and modern WiX projects in a solution. You can convert the WiX v3 projects to modern WiX gradually.
